# Security

Publishing a register is not just publishing data — postprocessing can **execute code**, either
your own or code pulled in from a register you import. Every register you import extends what
you're implicitly asking consumers to trust.

---

## `SECURITY.md`

Every register repository should carry a `SECURITY.md` alongside `README.md` and `LICENSE`. At
minimum, state:

- **Where to report a suspected issue** — a monitored email or a private channel (e.g. [GitHub
  private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)),
  not a public issue tracker.
- **What's in scope** — this repository's own sources (`transforms.yaml`, `plugins.transforms`/
  `plugins.validators` declarations, CI/CD workflows, `bblocks-config.yaml`). Most maintainers
  cannot vouch for imported registers — say so explicitly.
- **What a report should include** — the affected block identifier, the specific transform/plugin/
  import declaration, and whether the issue could propagate to registers that import this one.

[`bblock-template`](https://github.com/opengeospatial/bblock-template) doesn't ship a `SECURITY.md`
yet — write one by hand until the tooling generates and maintains it automatically.

## Code execution surface

A register with **no code of its own** can still execute code when built, from three sources:

- **`transforms.yaml`** — inline `python`, `node`, `jq`, `xslt`, SPARQL, or `semantic-uplift` logic,
  run automatically against matching example snippets during postprocessing. See
  [transforms.md](transforms.md).
- **Transform/validator plugins** — declared under `plugins.transforms` / `plugins.validators` in
  `bblocks-config.yaml`, installed via `pip`, which accepts any specifier `pip install` understands
  — including `git+https://...` URLs, i.e. code from anywhere the declaration points to. See
  [transform-plugins.md](transform-plugins.md) / [validation-plugins.md](validation-plugins.md).
- **Cross-block `get_transformer` / `getTransformer` calls** — can invoke a transform defined in a
  *different* block, including one reached only through an import.

A register that declares no transforms of its own is **not automatically free of executable
content** — it may have inherited some through an import (see [Imports and trust](#imports-and-trust)).

**How this runs depends on the environment:**

- **In CI**, the postprocessor runs unattended. Declared transforms and plugins execute
  automatically with whatever access the CI job has — secrets, network, write access. A slow or
  heavy transform also inflates CI cost.
- **Locally**, tooling asks for explicit confirmation before installing a plugin or running Python/
  Node transform code — this is what the `--skip-permissions` flag (see
  [local-iteration.md](local-iteration.md), [validation.md](validation.md)) bypasses. Reserve
  `--skip-permissions` for CI/agent runs you've already vetted; don't reach for it just to silence
  local prompts, since the prompt is the one point where a human actually looks at what's about to run.

Per-plugin virtualenv isolation prevents dependency conflicts — it is **not** a security boundary. A
plugin runs with whatever access the process running it has, regardless of which virtualenv it's in.

**Recommendations:**

- Review any new or changed `transforms.yaml` entry or plugin declaration like application code —
  because it is.
- Before adding/updating a `pip`/`git+https` plugin reference, check who maintains it and when it
  was last reviewed.
- Never commit CI credentials (e.g. `sparql.push` in `bblocks-config.yaml`, see
  [register-config.md](register-config.md)) to version control — use repository/organization
  secrets.
- Avoid broadening CI/CD workflow permissions beyond what postprocessing and publishing actually
  require.

## Imports and trust

`imports` in `bblocks-config.yaml` (see [imports-profiles.md](imports-profiles.md)) can reference
any register URL, OGC or not. Once imported, its `bblocks://` schema references, JSON-LD context,
and SHACL shapes are all inherited automatically — and any block in your repository can invoke a
transform defined in it.

- **Imports are transitive.** Importing one register also pulls in whatever *that* register
  imports, recursively — your real dependency set is a transitive closure, not the list you wrote.
- **Silence is still an import.** Omitting `imports` imports the main OGC register and everything
  it imports by default. Declare `imports: []` explicitly if you want none.
- **Imports aren't pinned.** Entries resolve by URL at build time — no version/commit/digest
  pinning, no lockfile. The same config rebuilt tomorrow may pull in different content.

Review a new import like a new dependency (maintainer, activity), and periodically re-check
existing imports, not just when adding them.

## Checking a register before trusting it

From a register's published `register.json` alone, without cloning it, you can check:

- which transform/validator plugins it declares, including the exact `pip` specifier each was
  installed from;
- the transform code each block declares, published alongside the blocks themselves;
- its import edges, and — resolving those recursively — its full transitive closure;
- the license applying to the register and to each block (`license` in `bblocks-config.yaml` or a
  block's own `bblock.json`, see [metadata.md](metadata.md)).

The OGC Blocks meta-register catalog (and its MCP server, where available) indexes this across
known registers so you can look up declared plugins, imports, and license without cloning.

None of this proves the content was actually *reviewed*, by whom, or whether an import's target has
changed since you last checked — that tracking is on the consumer.
