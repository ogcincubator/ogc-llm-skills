# OGC Blocks — Authoring Skill

This skill covers how to **author OGC Blocks** (bblocks): how to write, structure, and test the source
files that the postprocessor turns into reusable, machine-readable specification components.

Official branding is **OGC Blocks**. The legacy name is *OGC Building Blocks*. `bblocks` is the
code-level identifier used in file names, identifiers, and tooling.

## Prerequisites

Running the postprocessor or viewer locally (see [local-iteration.md](local-iteration.md),
[quickstart.md](quickstart.md)) requires **Docker**. All commands in this skill are written for a
POSIX shell (bash-style syntax, e.g. `$(pwd)`). **On Windows**, run them from
[Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) (bundled with Git for Windows) or, for the smoothest
experience, [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) with Docker Desktop's WSL 2
integration enabled — there is no `.bat`/PowerShell equivalent.

## What is an OGC Block?

An OGC Block is a reusable specification component packaged as a directory of source files. Each block
combines some or all of:

- a **JSON Schema** (the data model)
- a **JSON-LD context** (semantic annotations mapping JSON properties to RDF predicates)
- **SHACL shapes** (RDF graph constraints)
- **examples** with inline or file-referenced snippets
- **test resources** (additional files for automated validation)
- **transforms** (reusable conversion scripts)
- **metadata** (`bblock.json`)

The postprocessor reads these sources and produces:

- annotated schemas with semantic properties inlined
- assembled JSON-LD contexts
- generated HTML documentation
- validation reports
- a `register.json` index

A **register** is a collection of blocks published from a single repository.

## Design patterns

Blocks are commonly combined in a handful of recurring patterns. These aren't mutually exclusive —
a block can combine several — but naming the pattern you're after helps you find the right file:

| Pattern | What it is | See |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| **Aggregation/Composition** | A schema built by aggregating other blocks (e.g. via `$ref`/`allOf`) | [schema.md](schema.md) |
| **Extension** | Adds properties to another schema/model. Also a form of profiling: it constrains what an "open to extension" schema's extra content must look like | [schema.md](schema.md) |
| **Specialisation** | Constrains an existing attribute with a more specific model — e.g. fixing a `FeatureCollection`'s feature type | [extension-points.md](extension-points.md) |
| **Semantic annotation** | Binds schema elements to definitions via JSON-LD. Matters most when one schema could map to more than one ontology | [semantic/context.md](semantic/context.md) |
| **Profiling** | Adds constraints for a particular context; may combine specialisation, extension, rules, or vocabulary bindings. Declared via `isProfileOf` in `bblock.json` — the same relationship as `prof:isProfileOf` in the W3C [Profiles Vocabulary (PROF)](https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/) | [imports-profiles.md](imports-profiles.md) |
| **Vocabulary Bindings** | Constrains a value to a controlled vocabulary — static, or dynamic/service-backed (the latter needs a custom validator, since no standard covers it) | [validation-plugins.md](validation-plugins.md) |
| **Transformations** | A block defined around a transformation between specifications; validated against the post-transform target if that target is itself a block | [transforms.md](transforms.md) |
| **Testing examples** | A block scoped purely to supplying/testing examples for another specification | [examples.md](examples.md), [tests.md](tests.md) |
| **Documenting validators** | A block whose job is providing test cases, docs, and CI for a validation tool — typically tied to specific profiles | [validation-plugins.md](validation-plugins.md) |

The `resources` well-known role vocabulary (see [metadata.md](metadata.md#well-known-resource-roles))
is likewise reused directly from PROF's Resource Role instances, not invented independently.

## Key concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **register** | A published collection of blocks from one repo, indexed in `register.json` |
| **identifier** | Globally unique dot-separated string, e.g. `ogc.geo.features.feature` |
| **identifier prefix** | Per-repo string from `bblocks-config.yaml`; concatenated with the block's directory path to form its identifier |
| **annotated schema** | The postprocessor output schema: source schema + inherited `x-jsonld-*` annotations resolved |
| **assembled context** | The merged JSON-LD context built from a block's own context plus all imported blocks' contexts |
| **profile** | A block that specialises another via stricter constraints (see [Imports & Profiles](imports-profiles.md)) |
| **extension point** | A mechanism to substitute referenced blocks inside a base block's schema (see [Extension Points](extension-points.md)) |
